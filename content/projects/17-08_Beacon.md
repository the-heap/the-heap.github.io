project_brief = "Beacon wants to be a helpful tool that makes it easier to keep up to date with breaking changes in your applications when working on a team. If something breaks in a team application, it can take a while to find out what; you may have to crawl through some git logs or start yelling until someone tells you to calm down and what you need to do. Now you can avoid that by having a specific changelog that only deals with logging important breaking changes."
