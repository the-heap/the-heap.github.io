project_brief = "For this project, The Heap and it's contributors will be working on a slackbot that facilitates drawing! Our goal is to create Penny - a bot that can provide the members of our slack channel with prompts (visual ideas) for our team members to draw. Beyond dispensing drawing prompts we will try and build Penny in a way that it can accept drawing prompts from team members and store them in a database. If we hit these goals, then we'll also try and build out Penny's functionality to handle uploaded pictures of people's drawings and turn them into a gallery."
