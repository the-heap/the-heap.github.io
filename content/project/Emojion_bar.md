# Current Status

This project is currently in planning stages. It will become open to contribution for the month of May 2017.

# Description

Emojion Bar is a embeddable emoji reaction bar. Emojion Bar bubbled up while I was biking home and thinking of possible projects that could be part of The Heap. The idea was originally inspired (some may say, ripped off) from Slack's emoji functionality as well as Github's.
