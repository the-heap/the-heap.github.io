# Preface

THE HEAP is a place to work on open source projects. If you are a developer and want to work with a community to build something, you are in the right place.

That's great! Sometimes getting started and contributing can be a bit tricky, intimidating, and confusing. Thankfully, there are lots of smart and wonderful people who have  written documentation, guides, and tutorials for this very thing.

Here is a small list of links, hopefully useful in providing new-to-opensource the tools to participate.

- [How to contribut to an open source project on github](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

> This is a video series by Kent C Dodds. I have not actually watched this but I am certain it's very useful; both by his reputations as an excellent open source advocate, and ... just a gut feeling I have. I think that this video series will likely give you what you need to become familiar with Github, what pull requests are and how to get started navigating an open source project.
