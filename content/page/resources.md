# Preface

THE HEAP is a place to work on open source projects. If you are a developer and want to work with a community to build something, you are in the right place.

Sometimes getting started and contributing can be a bit tricky, intimidating, and confusing. Thankfully, there are lots of smart and wonderful people who have  written documentation, guides, and tutorials for this very thing.

Here is a list of links and notes, hopefully useful in providing those new-to-opensource the tools to participate. If you have suggestions for other links please let me know via [twitter](https://twitter.com/theheap_).

## Links

- [How to contribute to an open source project on github](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

> This is a video series by Kent C Dodds. I have not actually watched this but I am certain it's very useful; both by his reputations as an excellent open source advocate, and ... just a gut feeling I have. I think that this video series will likely give you what you need to become familiar with Github, what pull requests are and how to get started navigating an open source project.

## Notes

- Get to know Github. Try viewing issues on a github repo and explore filtering issues if there are labels / filters available. You might find filters that are relevant to your area of development interests.
- Get to know Github some more. Look for a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- Get to know the project you want to contribute to. Read the `README.md` as closely as you can! You'll likely find that it has links to important things you'll need to know.
