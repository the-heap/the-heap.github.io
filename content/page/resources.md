# Preface

*Read this document to:*

- Get familiar with the process of contributing to one of The Heap's projects.

*What The Heap expects:*

- A general familiarity with "[Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model)".
- A positive, kind, caring attitude from it's contributors and contributors-to-be.

# A Quick Overview

- The Heap _runs directed projects_ for a set period of time.
- This means that at The Heap we pick a project, plan for it, facilitate it's execution, and then eventually move on.
- Anybody can contribute to a project on The Heap - Developers, Designers, Project Managers, whatever you may be.
- A "contribution" is a broad term to describe you, the contributor, adding something of value to our project - whether it is code, an idea, comments, creating mockups, fixing spelling errors, filing bugs, helping plan, organizing teams, and so on.
- Our projects use *Roadmaps* (a list of what needs to be done) to determine what contributions are needed.
- The links and information below will seem overwhelming if you are new to Open source and coding in general. Like all new things to learn, you have to work hard, push yourself and fail (and fail fast). This is my opinion, and these resources are only suggested to help make contributing to open source a bit easier, less intimidating, and all in all -- more likely for your work to be happily accepted by project maintainers. Now that I'm done with my stern-disclaimer-thing, let's move on.

# Project Structure

We use a few tools to collaborate effectively across our projects. The following notes and screenshots will use an example project to give a quick overview of how we collaborate.

- Most of the activity regarding a project's status happens on Github, especially on the **issues* page. There you can find a Roadmap for every project to get started.
- The Heap casually releases videos to accompany projects sometimes as live coding, demonstrations, "office hours" and so on.  Subscribe to the [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIaeBxFZOzLA20sSAUENXRg) as you like. Playlists are used to group projects together.
- The Heap has a [Twitter account to tweet](https://twitter.com/theheap_) both about projects and programming (and life, the universe...). Follow us to stay in the loop.

# Resources

Sometimes getting started and contributing can be a bit tricky, intimidating, and confusing. Thankfully, there are lots of smart and wonderful people who have  written documentation, guides, and tutorials for this very thing.

Here is a list of links and notes, hopefully useful in providing those new-to-opensource the tools to participate. If you have suggestions for other links please let me know via [twitter](https://twitter.com/theheap_).

## Github

- [How to contribute to an open source project on github](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

> This is a video series by Kent C Dodds. I have not actually watched this but I am certain it's very useful; both by his reputations as an excellent open source advocate, and ... just a gut feeling I have. I think that this video series will likely give you what you need to become familiar with Github, what pull requests are and how to get started navigating an open source project.

## The "Learn Enough Series"

If you are not familiar with Git, Text editors and the Command Line you may have a hard time keeping up with a The Heap project. The `Learn Enough` series can be useful for getting up to date with some essential Developer Tools.

# General Notes / Recommendations

- Get to know Github. Try viewing issues on a github repo and explore filtering issues if there are labels / filters available. You might find filters that are relevant to your area of development interests.
- Get to know Github some more. Look for a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- Get to know the project you want to contribute to. Read the `README.md` as closely as you can! You'll likely find that it has links to important things you'll need to know.
