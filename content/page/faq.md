Q: _**Are these projects courses?**_

A: No

Q: _**Do I have to pay `$$$` ?**_

A: No. This is FREEEEEEE.

Q: _**Why didn't you respond to my PR or issue?**_

A: There's a good chance you didn't read the readme, contribution guidelines, or read the project roadmap. Many projects will be taking place over a short window of time and so there will not always be time to get a project done if dealing with contributions that (majorly) deviate from the purpose / goals or general roadmap.

Q: _**How come projects are only worked on for `X` amount of time?**_

A: First off, projects can continually be worked on for as long as they are here, hosted on `The Heap`. _However_, the current initiative of The Heap Projects, is to get a project done, within a window of time. Deadlines make things happen. The purpose here is to _focus_ on a single project by imposing restrictions â€” in this case time.

Q: _**Can I keep working or contributing to this after the time window is up?**_

A: Yes, but there is no promise that the maintainer of the project (The Heapmaster) will continue to maintain the project. You may be wasting your time creating issues or PR's _if_ the participants have moved on in their lives to other greater things.

Q: _**Why did/didn't you choose `X` tool or `Y` library for `Z` project?**_

A: It could be that I chose to build things a certain way out of interest to try new tools, get away from tools. The main goal, is to keep things simple.

Q: _**Why are you focused on keeping things simple?**_

A: Because I believe you need to work simply / do the dumbest thing first to get things done. As developers, (I at least) I think we're susceptible to over engineering, pre-optimizing, nerd-sniping etc. Simplicity, and boring methodologies sometimes are best.

Q: _**Who's running the show here?**_

A: [This guy](https://github.com/teesloane/)

Q: _**I don't want to work on your project; your idea is dumb.**_

A: That's not a question!
