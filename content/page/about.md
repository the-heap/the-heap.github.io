## The Heap from 10,000 Feet

The Heap runs open source projects. Anyone can join and collaborate.

Beyond facilitiating open source development, The Heap hopes to highlight the unique, creative, and hard work that other people in the open source community create.

Ideally this is a portal that springboards into a world of content creation (open source projects ) and content consumption (podcasts, articles, and thought pieces on programming and open source creation).

## Values

The Heap as an _entity_ has some high hopes:

_In Coding and Collaboration_

- Creating a welcoming space for people of all skills, abilities, and backgrounds to hack on things
- To keep things as simple as possible to get things done.
- To make and learn together

_In the OSS world at large_

- Looking at cool shit other people have made and discussing / trying to understand how it was built.
- Spreading the love for open source.
