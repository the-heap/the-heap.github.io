      <description>Q: Are these projects courses?
A: No
Q: Do I have to pay $$$ ?
A: No. This is FREEEEEEE.
Q: Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you respond to my PR or issue?
A: There&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you didn&amp;rsquo;t read the readme, contribution guidelines, or read the project roadmap. Many projects will be taking place over a short window of time and so there will not always be time to get a project done if dealing with contributions that (majorly) deviate from the purpose / goals or general roadmap.</description>

      <description>The Heap from 10,000 Feet The Heap runs open source projects. Anyone can join and collaborate.
Beyond facilitiating open source development, The Heap hopes to highlight the unique, creative, and hard work that other people in the open source community create.
Ideally this is a portal that springboards into a world of content creation (open source projects ) and content consumption (podcasts, articles, and thought pieces on programming and open source creation).</description>
